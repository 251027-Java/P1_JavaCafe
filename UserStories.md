Customer Stories:
1.	View Products
        As a customer, I want to see a list of available products on the Menu page, so I can browse what the cafe offers.
        If a product is marked out of stock by an admin, it should not appear or be selectable on the menu or order pages.

2.	View Product Details
        As a customer, I want to click a “View More” button on any product to see detailed information in a popup/modal, so I can decide if I want to order it.

3.	Search and Filter Products
        As a customer, I want to search products by name and/or filter by category, so I can quickly find relevant items.

4.	Select Multiple Products
        As a customer, I want to select multiple products via checkboxes after searching/filtering, so I can choose all items I want to order.

5.	Add to Cart
        As a customer, I want to add selected products to my cart with one button click, so I can efficiently build my order.

6.	Continue Shopping
        As a customer on the Place Order page, I want to keep searching and adding more products, so I can complete my order without leaving the page.

7.	Manage Cart
        As a customer, I want to view items in my cart, adjust quantities, remove items, and see the updated item costs based on quantity selected as well as the total cost, so I can manage my order.

8.	Clear Cart
        As a customer, I want to clear my cart to start over if I change my mind.

9.	Place Order
        As a customer, I want to press the “Place Order” button and be prompted to log in if I am not authenticated, so my order is linked to me.

10.	Order Confirmation
        As a logged-in customer, I want to see an order confirmation page with my order number and summary, so I know my order was received.
        
11.	Order Lookup
        As a customer, I want to look up my existing order by entering my order number and logging in if needed, so I can check the order status.
        The order status shown should always reflect the most recent update made by the admin.
        If I’m already logged in, I don’t want to log in again.

12.	Prompt to Order
        As a customer, if I visit the order lookup page without any orders or account, I want to be prompted with a “Place an Order” button.

Admin Stories:
1.	Admin Account Management
        As an admin, I want my account to be pre-created and managed securely by system owners, so that only authorized personnel can access the admin panel.
        There should be no public option to create admin accounts.

2.	Admin Login
        As an admin, I want to log in with my email and password, so I can access management features.

3.	View Orders
        As an admin, I want to view all customer orders with timestamps and status, so I can track and manage fulfillment.

4.	Update Order Status
        As an admin, I want to toggle order statuses between pending and complete, so I can update fulfillment progress.
        Order status changes should be immediately reflected in the customer’s order lookup page.

5.	Manage Product Availability
        As an admin, I want to update product availability (available/out of stock), so the menu reflects real-time stock.
        Products marked out of stock should no longer be visible or selectable by customers on the menu and Place Order pages.
        
6.	View Sales Summary
        As an admin, I want to see a sales summary showing date, total orders, and total items sold, so I can monitor business performance.
        
7.      Browser View Changed
        As as admin presses "Admin login" button on on any main page, all the pages including: menu, place order, and order lookup are disapear. And a new admin page with login is prompted only on the browser now.
